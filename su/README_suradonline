Multiple removal with Radon transform

There are many versions or high resolution RTs in directory

/home/dtrad/seismic

The most common are:

suradonline.cpp   (freq domain)
suradonlinetd.cpp (time domain)

Two newer simplified versions are:
suradonfreq.cpp (freq domain)
suradontx.cpp   (time domain)

All these codes input a 2D line of data and output the multiple attenuated same line:

Usually they do the following:
1) apply nmo
2) predict the Radon space
3) mute some are of the RT space
4) predict multiples
5) subtract from the data with least squares scaling
6) apply inverse nmo

The simples to use is suradonfreq.
Typing suradonfreq without arguments returns the following help

 Input must be sort by cdp and offset, for example                   
                   susort cdp offset < input | .....                 
                                                                     
 It removes This program is intended to input a line of data sort    
 by cdps and, every cdp by offset.                                   
                                                                     
 Notes:                                                              
 Most parameters have reasonable default values. The most important  
 parameters to set (for which there is no default for every data set 
 are: cdpmin, cdpmax, par and qmin.                                  
 solver defines whether to have high resolution RT (cgfft)          
 or standard RT (toep).                                              
 rtmethod defines if working with linear (1) , parabolic (2) o       
 pseudohyperbolic RT (3). In this last case need to set also depth

This is the most flexible of all because of the options for muting.

It is easier to design the mute with suradonline.
In suradonline a single parameter is given to design the mute zone.
For an example of applying suradonline with the mississippi Canyon data
see 

/home/dtrad/seismic/su/Xsuradonline_miss


In this example, a single cdp is processed. stkvel.misscn.su is he
parfile with velocity information along the line.

NAME=cdp1000 # One cdp

PAR=stkvel.misscn.su
FILE=$NAME'.su'
FILEOUT=$NAME'.demul.su'

CDPMIN=1000
CDPMAX=1000
dxcdp=1
mute=1  # subtract multiples      
t0mute=3.8  # initial muting time
parmute=1.5e-9 # parameter that separates prim from multiples


suradonline < $FILE  cdpmin=$CDPMIN cdpmax=$CDPMAX dxcdp=$dxcdp par=$PAR itercg=30 iter_end=3 eps2=5e-1 eps1=5e-1 nq=110  norm=0 mute=1  parmute=$parmute qmin=-0.25e-8 factor=1.5 fmax=80 solver=cgfft t0mute=$t0mute > $FILEOUT

By default, it is created an auxiliar file called model.su, that contains
the Radon space. This is important to check that the Radon parameters are
allright, in particular parmute.
There are many parameters that can be changed for tests, but most of them 
have good defaults. It is important to tune properly parmute, qmin and factor.
Factor is by default = 0.8, it means 0.8 the minimum sampling interval in the Radon space to prevent model aliasing. However, since this is for the maximum 
frequency given by fmax, it is possible to increase factor wihtout affecting 
seriously the process.
