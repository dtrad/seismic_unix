Half a life
I think writters must be sad people, because is only in sadness that the heart can express. This is one of the saddest moments of my life, so it could be a good moment to start writing. 
For ten years I have the blessing of loving and being loved, at least, I always thought that, to the most beatiful person I had the luck of crossing in life. She was my wife, my partner, my best friend , my teacher and my child, my morning and my night. She was the sugar of my coffe, and the fire of my heart. I thought she was going to be always there for me, like my own life. Perhaps, I forgot to fed her with my own fire. 

She left me for reasons that cannot be explained, nor understand, like it is not possible to understand death, taking away from us the dawn and the dusk. 

Now I am half dead. Perhaps I will born again, some day, I don't know, and I don't care. I could be upset, but I would prefer to look at the bright side of the life, and remember the best we had, and thanks God for that. 

I remember walking along the life, without knowing where nor why, only with the certainty of seeing her at night at home, laughing about nothing and talking so freely, like I were alone. I remember huging her at night with the feeling of flying over the rocks of the path, like if she were my wings.

I remember helping her to fight her life, and because of that feeling to be the hero of our lives. So many words, so many times trusting and abandoning ourselves in each other arms, so many times holding firmly her hands at night, the old secret signal we had. 
  
Now all that is gone, but not forgotten. Now it is time to look inside, or better to look up there. These days of lonely silent I can see the deep hole in my life, that I cannot fill it anymore, I wish I could. Sometimes I look at the empty chair, in the empty space, where no fire heat my heart. Only my own cold sadness radiates around me. No more jokes, no more laughing, no more happy moments, just life with its cold days, and its brief illusions of success, invariable followed by the bitter reality of desert love.

answer:

It is really beautiful and very appropriate for the big step you have
taken. It seems that this jump has become the essence of your life. 
Remember, however, that sometimes the darkness of the unknown could not be
what you expect, and there are also hills difficult to climb. The
happiness you are pursuing may be either in the unknown darkness, or at
the other side of the hill. You cannot say, until try one of them. I
jumped a few times, and I climbed others. For me, most of the time the
happiness was at the top of the hill, or even sometimes, in my way to it. 
Not even at the other side. Other times, it has been in the unknown. 
Choose what you believe, and stick to your choice. If it was wrong, never
regret. This is what I always failed to do. 
My best for you always

Sorry if I was hateful in the previous email, but what I said is what I
learnt after my painful experience in Balseiro. I jumped, I failed, I
suffered. I did not learn how to fly. I learnt that if I wanted to
acchieve success, I had to do it climbing mountains. And I did, still I am
doing it, and close to the top. However, I always wanted you to arrive
with me.
Now I may arrive alone, and that is not what I dreamt. 
Sorry, for not saying just a simple "Oh yah it is beautiful", it is but it
is not the whole truth

It is easier for you to say it, than for me. But is true, when 
there is happiness inside the heart, everything looks brighter.
Actually the true hero is who can keep that happiness inside the heart,
when every thing around falls down. For the rest of us, happiness is
just a reflection of our success, unfortunaly. I wish I were a true 
hero. Fortunaly, still there is a God that complements our weakness, but  
sometimes He hides to give us the chance to try to be heroes.
